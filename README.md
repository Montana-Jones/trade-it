Welcome to Trade-It. This is an application designed for UGA students who are looking to trade or sell items.

Start by creating an account so you can browse items and put items up for trade/sale. You can browse by categories. If you're selling something
that doesn't fit any categories listed, you can add a new one. You can list items for sale or for free.

You can express interest in an item. If the seller is interested as well, you can meet up for the exchange. Once the exchange is complete, go to
your pending transactions and indicate that it has been completed.

Get started today!
